    The objective of the homework was to generate an Employee Summary using inquirer which renders into an team.HTML file. The first portion of the homework was to run tests to ensure the constructor classes are configured correctly. From there it is building out the inquirer portion to create employess which incorportaes logic to render the appropriate data for each employee.
